Baby Sitting is an application to **create connections** between **families** and **babysitters** in different **cities**    (Bordeaux, Marseille, Paris, London, Philly).

I have a huge interest about **Elixir and Phoenix** and I wanted to try them on a **simple CRUD app** with some fancy features (multi-locale / multi-domain / payment system / etc ...).

This was the **very first app** I created with these languages, you'll not find **"quality"** nor **"good practices"** in this repo (the architecture cries for abstraction and a better organisation).
